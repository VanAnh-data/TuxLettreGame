# 3D Word Puzzle Game

## 🧠 About the Project

This project is a **3D word puzzle game** developed using **Java**, **XML**, **XSLT**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. The player controls a character who navigates a virtual room filled with boxes. Each box displays a **letter on the floor**, and together they form a **hidden word**.

The goal: **memorize the word in 5 seconds**, and then **rearrange the boxes** to form the correct word **within 30 to 60 seconds**, depending on the difficulty level.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

* 🧍 You control a 3D character inside a room.
* 🧊 The room contains boxes, each with a letter on the ground.
* ⏱️ You have **5 seconds** to look at and memorize the correct word.
* 🧩 After the word disappears, you must rearrange the boxes to spell the correct word.
* ⌛ You have **30 to 60 seconds** to complete the puzzle.
* ✅ Win by placing all letters in the correct order before time runs out.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Java** – Game logic and core mechanics.
* **XML** – Configuration of scenes and levels.
* **XSLT** – Transforming XML data for display or interaction.
* **HTML/CSS** – UI and visual presentation.

## 🚧 Features (In Progress / Planned)

* Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
* Timer and scoring system
* 3D character movement and interaction
* Word database (easy, medium, hard)
* Hints and retry options

## 📦 Installation & Run

> *Note: Setup instructions may vary depending on your environment*

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TuxLettreGame.git
   cd TuxLettreGame
   ```

2. Compile the Java files and launch the game. (Netbean, Vscode...)

3. Ensure any XML/XSLT processors are correctly configured if running in a browser or Java-based environment.

## 🎯 Goals

* Encourage memory, spelling, and problem-solving skills.
* Merge educational content with an immersive 3D game experience.
* Explore the integration of **Java logic with web technologies** like XML/XSLT.
